# Task 3 – Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn, so retention strategies can be applied.

## 📊 Key Steps
- Preprocessed Telco Churn dataset (One-Hot Encoding for categoricals).
- Train-test split for model validation.
- Trained Logistic Regression model.

## 📈 Metrics
- Accuracy: ~80%
- Confusion Matrix showed good balance between churners and non-churners.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn (LogisticRegression, train_test_split, metrics)

## ✅ Outcome
Built a baseline churn prediction model to identify customers at risk of leaving.
