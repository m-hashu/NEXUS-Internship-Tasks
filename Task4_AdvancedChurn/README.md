# Task 4 – Advanced Churn Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Improve churn prediction accuracy with advanced models.

## 📊 Key Steps
- Feature scaling with StandardScaler.
- Trained Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.
- Evaluated with Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC.

## 📈 Metrics
- Random Forest: Recall ~0.50, F1 ~0.56
- XGBoost: Recall ~0.52, F1 ~0.54

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier, metrics)
- XGBoost

## ✅ Outcome
Tree-based models provided better recall than Logistic Regression, which is crucial for catching churners.
